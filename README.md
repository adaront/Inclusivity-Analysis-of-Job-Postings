# Inclusivity Analysis of UK Job Postings

This project analyzes data from 5000 job postings in the UK to evaluate their inclusivity scores. The dataset contains scores for various categories of inclusivity, including gender, ethnicity, age, and ability.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to examine the inclusivity of job postings in the UK and identify areas where improvements can be made. By analyzing the data, we can gain insights into how job postings are currently constructed and whether they are welcoming to a diverse range of candidates.
### Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is contained in the file data.csv. The file contains the following fields:
- Score_overall: overall inclusivity score of the ad
- Score_men: inclusivity score with regards to men
- Score_women: inclusivity score with regards to women
- Score_non_conforming: inclusivity score with regards to people not conforming to stereotypical gender roles and expectations (LGBTQ+)
- Score_advantaged_ethnicity: inclusivity score with regards to the advantaged or privileged ethnic groups
- Score_disadvantaged_ethnicity: inclusivity score with regards to disadvantaged or marginalized ethnic groups

### Analysis
The analysis was conducted using Python. The code used for the analysis can be found in the Code folder of this repository.
We explored the dataset using various statistical and visualization techniques to gain insights into the inclusivity scores. Our findings suggest that there is room for improvement in the inclusivity of job postings, particularly with regards to marginalized groups such as the disabled and neurodivergent.
### Presentation
A Powerpoint presentation summarizing our findings and insights can be found in the Presentation folder of this repository.
